Floyds Triangle
Problem Description:
You are given an integer n. Your task is to return the first n rows of Floydâ€™s Triangle, represented as a list of strings. Floyd's Triangle is a triangular array of natural numbers where the first row contains 1, the second row contains 2 and 3, the third row contains 4, 5, and 6, and so on.

Input:
A single integer n, where 1 <= n <= 100.

Output:
A list of strings where each string represents a row in Floyd's Triangle.

Example:
Input: 5
Output: ['1', '2 3', '4 5 6', '7 8 9 10', '11 12 13 14 15']
Input: 3
Output: ['1', '2 3', '4 5 6']
